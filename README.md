Adding dzikawa. An "artist" who is willing to be corrupted and joins in with bullying and hate speech without flinching. Even long-time supporters are mercilessly bullied by her and her team. Categories: Malware, hate-and-junk, scam and abuse. 
Scam because there are very significant similarities, especially her Mononoke thing, to another artist and dzikawa's paintings look as if they were traced by him. Also adding stumpyfongo for similar reasons.
